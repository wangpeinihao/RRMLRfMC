Description: Fit the reduced-rank multinomial logistic regression model for Markov
    chains developed by Wang et al.(2021)<doi:10.1002/sim.8923> in R. It combines
    the ideas of multinomial logistic regression in Markov chains and reduced-rank.
    It is very useful in a study where multi-states model is assumed and each transition 
    among the states is controlled by a series of covariates. The key advantage 
    is to reduce the number of parameters to be estimated. The final coefficients 
    for all the covariates and the p-values for the interested covariates will be 
    reported. The p-values for the whole coefficient matrix can be calculated by 
    two bootstrap methods.
