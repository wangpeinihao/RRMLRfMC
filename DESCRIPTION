Description: Fit the reduced-rank multinomial logistic regression (MLR) model for 
    Markov chains in R. It combines the ideas of MLR in Markov chains and reduced-rank.
    It will be very useful in a study where mult-states model is assumed and each 
    transition among the states is controlled by a series of covariates. The key 
    advantage is to reduce the number of parameters to be estimated. The final coefficients
    for all the covariates and the p-values for the intested covariates will be reported.
    The p-values for the whole coefficient matrix can be calculated by two bootstrap 
    methods.
