# RRMLRfMC

This package provides the code to fit a reduced rank multinomial logistic regression for markov chains which was proposed by Wang et al. (2020). Since RRMLRfMC is useful for analyzing transitions among states and the transition probabilities that are influenced by covariates, it will be a helpful research tool in a multi-states model where users want to investigate the effects of the study covariates adjusted for the presence of other covariates.
